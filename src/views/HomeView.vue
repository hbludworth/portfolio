            I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for building beautiful, functional, and
            scalable web applications. I've developed many projects in various positions including
            as a full-time student, a freelance developer, a project manager, and even as a
            technical cofounder. I excel at understanding complex problems, building powerful
            solutions, and developing products that customers need. Having recently graduated in
            Entrepreneurship and Computer Science, I am currently looking for a full-time position
            as a software engineer and am confident that I can be a valuable asset to any team.

            During my three years as a full stack developer, and as an Entrepreneurship and Computer
            Science student at Brigham Young University, I've had the opportunity to work on many
            fun, challenging, and rewarding projects. I've used many different technologies and
            languages to build some cool stuff. Here are a few of my favorites.
