            I'm an experienced full stack software engineer with a passion for building beautiful,
            functional, and scalable web applications. I currently work as a Senior Full Stack
            Engineer at Fidelity Investments. I've developed many projects in various positions
            including as a full-time employee, a freelance developer, a project manager, and even as
            a technical cofounder. I excel at understanding complex problems, building powerful
            solutions, and developing products that customers need.
