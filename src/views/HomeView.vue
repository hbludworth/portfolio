            I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for building beautiful, functional, and
            scalable web applications. I've developed many projects in various positions including
            as a full-time student, a freelance developer, a project manager, and even as a
            technical cofounder. I excel at understanding complex problems, building powerful
            solutions, and developing products that customers need. Having recently graduated in
            Entrepreneurship and Computer Science, I am currently looking for a full-time position
            as a software engineer and am confident that I can be a valuable asset to any team.
