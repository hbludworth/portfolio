# My Portfolio

This repository is home to a simple portfolio website meant to showcase my web development experience and demonstrate my technical abilities. The site is built with Vue, Bulma, and TypeScript and is currently hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

Running this portfolio application locally is pretty straightforward. I've included descriptions for some of the most used scripts below.

## Scripts

- `yarn dev` - This will start a development instance of the server that can be accessed at `localhost:5173`.
- `yarn build` - This will build a production-ready distribution of the site and places it in a folder called `dist` in the root directory.
- `yarn lint` - This will run ESLint with the `--fix` flag set.
- `yarn format` - This will use Prettier to automatically format the codebase.

## Build Path

By default, builds for the project will be output to the `dist` directory at the root of the project.
