# My Portfolio

This repository is home to a simple portfolio website meant to demonstrate my web development skills. The site is built with Vue, Bulma, and TypeScript, is hosted on AWS S3, and available through AWS CloudFront.

Because the setup is pretty straightforward, I've just included descriptions of some of the basic scripts below.

## Scripts

- `yarn dev` - This will start a development instance of the server that can be accessed at `localhost:5173`.
- `yarn build` - This will build a production-ready distribution of the site and places it in a folder called `dist` in the root directory.
